# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r squared value is a value that represents how well the line of best fit represents the data. The closer to one the value is the better it represents the data.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?

The predicted value according to the model is 137.46.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

It is a fairly decent prediction and could be used for general purposes but for medical sutff it would probably be best not to use it. To improve the model we could add more data so that the prediction would be more reliable.
